    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <h4><p>Hi! I am Nathaniel Ysaac Palaganas, an IT student aspiring to enroll and graduate in animation. I have skill and knowledge about digital and pixel arts, as well as traditional.
    I am confident of my skill and talent in digital art, specially in detailed anime illustration. I've posted some of my work in social medias such as Instagram and X(formerly know as twitter).</p>
    <p>My goal is to broaden my skills, learn and master animation and creation of sprites, characters, visual effects, and others that involves animation. 
    Such that I can help video game developers create their character models and help them easily hire a professional.</p></h4>
